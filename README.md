# Optimum Energy Paint Bot Problem

## Proposed by Landon Schropp

This repository contains my development work and answer to Landon Schropp&apos;s **_Optimum Energy Paint
Bot Problem_**.

In brief, this problem calls for a 10 x 10 grid (10<sup>2</sup> squares), or 100 squares over which a paint
bot may traverse in up, down, left or right direction. As the bot traverses each square, it paints it.

The directions the bot travels are to be contained within a text file of directions (left, right, up, down)
and read by the program to determine which direction the bot will travel.

At the end of the bot&apos;s journey, the ending location on the grid will be output, as well as the total
number of squares painted by the bot.

My chosen development platform is full stack JavaScript, so the base technologies involved will be ECMAScript
(with the most practically applied modern standards) and Node.js.

Time allowing, I will develop a front-end web page with a graphic representation of the grid and some simple bot
icon that will move across it. Additionally, I would consider adding the information of the starting coordinate
of the bot, just for completeness.
